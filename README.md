# work-utils

This is a repo to hold my programming scripts and tips and tricks used for work. It will be a messy and mixed bag of things but if they are committed here they should be tested and working.

List
- python-emailer: command line emails, and email automation for alerts, etc.
- python-timelapse: create timelapse videos, capture images from multiple cameras.
- vnc_tools: enable screen forwarding over ssh
